This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website, which is live at https://ssy2306.github.io/HTML/index/homepage.html.

About the website
I have built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a responsive design that looks good on all devices. The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects.

The "**About Me**" section provides more details about my background, education, and work experience.

The website is still a work in progress, and I am currently working on the backend, which will include database connectivity.
